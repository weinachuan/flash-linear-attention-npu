"""Canonical runtime/version compatibility tables.

Single source of truth shared by:
- scripts/check_npu_env.py (build/runtime preflight)
- the PyPI import guard embedded into tiered wheels at build time
  (generated torch_custom/fla_npu/fla_npu/_compat.py; the guard only emits
  advisory RuntimeWarnings for below-minimum versions and never blocks import)

Keep the public promise aligned with the README and the wheel metadata: CANN
>= 8.5.2 (a2/a3) or >= 9.0.0 (a5), torch >= 2.7.1, torch_npu >=
TORCH_NPU_GDN_FIX_MINIMUMS[torch], triton-ascend >= 3.2.1 on CANN 9.x
(9.0.0+).
