"""Stable-ABI backend (Phase 1).

Loads ``libfla_npu_stable.so`` (a plain shared object registered through
``STABLE_TORCH_LIBRARY``) and exposes the same Python call shape as the ctypes
reference.  This module contains no ABI-sensitive code: the only tensor objects
crossing the boundary are handled by torch's own dispatcher.

The mutation contract (version bump / requires_grad rejection) is *not*
provided by the dispatcher for these ops -- measured in Phase 1 -- so the
